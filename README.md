# BeZenAssignment
This repository contains the assignment for the internship opportunity at Be Zen

The assignment contains the solution for the four questions provided.
1. Products without prices
2. Count of products without prices and with prices in each Product Type, Category, Level 1

There were three approaches used to solve Question 2. 
- Approach 1: Using the complete DataFrame
- Approach 2: Using subsets of the original DataFrame: With and Without Null Values
- Approach 3: Using the subsets above and evaluating individulally w.r.t 'product_type', 'category' and 'level_1

4. Correct Product Prices in the correct format (eg: $56) wherever possible and separate them into currency and value columns.
5. List out the categories with average price of product.

The assignment was implemented in python using google colab
